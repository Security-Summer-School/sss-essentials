# Data Representation

## Introduction

In today's session we'll be discussing data and the many ways we can represent it.

## Reminders and Prerequisites

For this session you'll need:
- Basic knowledge of Python (as seen in the [first session](../welcome-to-linux/))
- Numbers

## What is Data?

Data is information.
This plain text is data, but more than that, data can be encoded and represented in many ways.  
Generally, we represent data in a suitable format for our specific purpose.  
For example, if we want the most basic way to encode data, the one that computers "think" in, we'll use `Binary`.  
Sometimes, we need our data to not be confused with something else, so, for example we encode `Binary` to `Base-64` in order to get the information on the other side of the wire uncorrupted.

## Data Formats

### Numeral Systems
Numeral Systems are a method of representing numbers by mathematical combinations of symbols.

![Numeral Systems 1](./assets/numeral_systems1.svg)

Humans prefer the `decimal` numeral system (also know as Base-10), since it provides better readability.  
Therefore, written software (i.e. code) is mostly `Base-10`, as humans write software far more than they build hardware.

Computers, on the other hand, use binary (or Base-2), the numerical system that uses two digits (0 and 1), which are also known as `bits` and `bytes` (1 byte = 8 bits)

But why?  
Hardware prefers them, since they are associated easier with electrical signals:

![Data Signals](./assets/data_signals.svg)

Of course, there is also an in-between: Hexadecimal.  
Also known as Base-16, it uses 10 digits (0-9) and 6 alphabet letters (A-F).   
Hexadecimal data is both readable and tightly correlated to the binary representation.  
Let's say we have `0b10101001` (`10101001`).  
I assume you can safely say that since we have 8 bits, it will be `< 256`.  
Its hexadecimal form is `0xa9` (`a9`).  
Thus, if we want to convert it to `decimal`, instead of doing 8 steps:

$(1 × 2^7) + (0 × 2^6) + (1 × 2^5) + (0 × 2^4) + (1 × 2^3) + (0 × 2^2) + (0 × 2^1) + (1 × 2^0) = 169$

we only do 2 steps:

$(a × 16^1) + (9 × 16^0) = 169$

Some conversions:
```py
# binary <――> decimal
def binToDec(n):
    return int(n,2)

def decToBin(n):
    return bin(n)

# hexadecimal <――> decimal
def hexToDec(n):
    return int(n, 16)

def decToHex(n):
    return hex(n)

# binary <――> hexadecimal
def binToHex(n):
    return(decToHex(binToDec(n)))

def hexToBin(n):
    return(decToBin(hexToDec(n)))

# Back and forth conversions
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f"0b1111 ―――> {binToDec('0b1111')}")
    print(f"15 ―――> {decToBin(15)}")

    print(f"0xa9 ―――> {hexToDec('0xa9')}")
    print(f"169 ―――> {decToHex(169)}")

    print(f"0b111101111011 ―――> {binToHex('0b111101111011')}")
    print(f"0xf7b ―――> {hexToBin('0xf7b')}")
```

And their output:
```
0b1111 ―――> 15
15 ―――> 0b1111
0xa9 ―――> 169
169 ―――> 0xa9
0b111101111011 ―――> 0xf7b
0xf7b ―――> 0b111101111011
```

#### Octal
Octal or Base-8 uses 8 digits (0-7).  
It is the least popular of the aforementioned 4, but an interesting use of it is in the Unix File Permissions system:

Here is a table that shows what each permissions does on a file, respectively on a directory.
![Unix File Permissions 1](./assets/unix_file_permissions1.svg)

Each file/directory has three sets of permissions:
`Owner`,
`Group Owner`,
`Others`

So, if we want to view the permissions of a file/directory we execute:
```bash
root@kali:~# ls -l File_Name
-rwxrw-r-- 1 root root 1000 Sep 10 2020 File_Name
-[-][-][-]   [--] [--]
| |  |  |     ||   ||
| |  |  |     ||   ||
| |  |  |     ||   ++----------------> 6. Group
| |  |  |     ++---------------------> 5. Owner
| |  |  +----------------------------> 4. Others Permissions
| |  +-------------------------------> 3. Group Permissions
| +----------------------------------> 2. Owner Permissions
+------------------------------------> 1. File Type
```

```

We can see that by adding 32 to an uppercase letter, we get that same letter in lowercase:  
e.g. `E + 32 = e`

Below, you can see the built-in Python functions `ord` and `chr` that help us determine what character coresponds to a certain ASCII code and what ASCII code a character has.
```py
>>> ord('E')
69
>>> chr(69)
'E'
>>> chr(ord('E') + 32)
'e'
>>> chr(ord('e') - 32)
'E'
>>>
```

In terms of storage efficiency, we can encode  
`UTF-8` for ASCII text (English and other Western languages)  
`UTF-16` for non-ASCII text (Chinese and other Asian languages)

Let's say we have a string in Chinese. With Python, we can get the hex bytes of the string, using the built-in function `str.encode()`:
```py
Str = ("老板")
print(Str)

Str = (("老板").encode("utf-8"))
print(Str)
```
The output will be:
```
老板
b'\xe8\x80\x81\xe6\x9d\xbf'
```
If we want to get back to the original string, we will execute:
```py
print((Str.decode()))
```
And we will get:
```
老板
```

#### Base64

Base64 is a way of representing binary data in sequences of 24 bits (3 bytes) that can be represented by 4 Base64 digits.

Base64 Encoding Table:
```
Index   Char      Index   Char      Index   Char      Index   Char        
0       A         16      Q         32      g         48      w   
1       B         17      R         33      h         49      x
2       C         18      S         34      i         50      y
3       D         19      T         35      j         51      z
4       E         20      U         36      k         52      0
5       F         21      V         37      l         53      1
6       G         22      W         38      m         54      2
7       H         23      X         39      n         55      3
8       I         24      Y         40      o         56      4
9       J         25      Z         41      p         57      5
10      K         26      a         42      q         58      6
11      L         27      b         43      r         59      7
12      M         28      c         44      s         60      8
13      N         29      d         45      t         61      9
14      O         30      e         46      u         62      +
15      P         31      f         47      v         63      /
```

If we want to convert to and from Base64 in Python we can use the `base64` module:
```py
import base64

message = "Some random message"
message_bytes = message.encode('ascii') # We transform the string to "b'Some random message'", making it a sequence of bytes
base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(message_bytes) 
base64_message = base64_bytes.decode('ascii') # We do the opposite of the previous process, now eliminating "b''", to make it a string

print(base64_message)
```
Thus getting us to the base64 string:
```
U29tZSByYW5kb20gbWVzc2FnZQ==
```

If we would want to decode it, we would have to simply revert the commands as follows:
```py
import base64

base64_message = 'U29tZSByYW5kb20gbWVzc2FnZQ=='
base64_bytes = base64_message.encode('ascii')
message_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_bytes)
message = message_bytes.decode('ascii')

print(message)
```
Which will get us back to:
```
Some random message
```

As you can see, some Base64 strings have "=" at the end, some have "==" and others have nothing uncommon.  
Since Base64 represents binary data in 3 bytes, we should also know how to treat the case when the length is not divisible by 3.  
As a consequence, there is output padding for Base64 as follows:

```
length % 3 = 1 => "=="
length % 3 = 2 => "="
length % 3 = 0 => no padding
```

The following can be used to better understand output padding:
```py
import base64

text1 = "SecuritySummmerSch"
text2 = "SecuritySummmerScho"
text3 = "SecuritySummmerSchoo"
text4 = "SecuritySummmerSchool"

b64_text1 = (base64.b64encode(text1.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')
b64_text2 = (base64.b64encode(text2.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')
b64_text3 = (base64.b64encode(text3.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')
b64_text4 = (base64.b64encode(text4.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')

print(f"Plain text\t\tPT length\tBase64 text\t\t\tB64 length")
print(f"{text1}\t{len(text1)}\t\t{b64_text1}\t{len(b64_text1)}")
print(f"{text2}\t{len(text2)}\t\t{b64_text2}\t{len(b64_text2)}")
print(f"{text3}\t{len(text3)}\t\t{b64_text3}\t{len(b64_text3)}")
print(f"{text4}\t{len(text4)}\t\t{b64_text4}\t{len(b64_text4)}")
```

We get:
```html
Plain text              PT length       Base64 text                     B64 length
SecuritySummmerSch      18              U2VjdXJpdHlTdW1tbWVyU2No        24
SecuritySummmerScho     19              U2VjdXJpdHlTdW1tbWVyU2Nobw==    28
SecuritySummmerSchoo    20              U2VjdXJpdHlTdW1tbWVyU2Nob28=    28
SecuritySummmerSchool   21              U2VjdXJpdHlTdW1tbWVyU2Nob29s    28
```


Try decoding yourself!

#### Hashing

A good way to compress data is represented by hashing.  
Data can be stored in hashes; hashes can be stored in hash tables, thus enabling quicker data lookup.

But how does it work?

A hashing algorithm is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input data array of a certain type and arbitrary length to an output bit string of a fixed length.  
The process is one-way, as you cannot convert a hash back to the original data, like making a banana smoothie, as seen in the image below:

![Blender Hashing](./assets/blender_hashing.svg)

As you can see, you cannot make a banana back from the juice, so `unhashing` is impossible.

Hashes establish identity between inputs because they are unique.
We can safely assume that if 2 inputs have the same hash, they are identical.

We can also use hashes for data encryption.
We can find the hash of a some data in a lot of ways. Some of them are:

1. Getting the hash (`md5` in this case) of a text using `Bash`

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo -n "Random plaintext" | md5sum
1155bd70728d5dc0e1856f7742621d94  -
```

We can see that by adding, changing or deleting a character from the text, radically changes the hash:
```bash
root@kali:~$ echo -n "Random plaintextt" | md5sum
43052701309339b0a084bfbe5a5e531c
root@kali:~$ echo -n "Random plaintest" | md5sum
29adfa240cda59153245464ed8de4ec1
root@kali:~$ echo -n "Random plaintex" | md5sum
d992ee83f3675b4021e0bb614021ffeb
```

2. Getting the hash (`sha-1` in this case) of a text using `Python`:

We will use the module `hashlib` in order to get hashes in Python:

```py
import hashlib

text = "some kind of text"
h = hashlib.sha1(text.encode('ascii'))

print(h.hexdigest())
```

This code would provide the following `sha-1` hash:
```
1145d8b71c84d1b0a717d36bd0cd6638697bd606
```

We can store passwords as MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-2 (most popular ones), so that in case of a security breach, the real passwords are still hidden.  
An unsecure and naive way of storing passwords is:

```
|  User   |      Password      |
|:-------:|:------------------:|
| Robert  | S3cur3.p@ssw0rd?   |
| Maria   | Palmademallorca123 |
| Ciprian | password           |
```

A much better approach is to store the passwords hashed, as mentioned above:
```
|  User   |             Password             |
|:-------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Robert  | 0daeb943b4cc762da2c541c7338c90b6 |
| Maria   | 9daa2547b9a0155841d7f653257e3762 |
| Ciprian | 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 |
```


## Summary

Data can be represented in many ways, with different purposes.

Some useful information from today:
- Base64 is encoding, not encrypting
- Computers love `binary`, humans love `decimal`, and they both have a thing for `hexadecimal`
- We need the `base64` and `hashlib` modules imported in our Python scripts in order for us to work with `Base64` encoding/decoding and `Hashing`

Some useful Python commands from today:
- Convert Binary to Decimal - `int(n,2)`
- Find the ASCII code - `ord('X')`
- Find a character based on its ASCII code - `chr(88)`
- Encode in Base64 format - `(base64.b64encode(text1.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')`
- Decode from Base64 format - `(base64.b64decode(base64_message.encode('ascii'))).decode('ascii')`

### Challenge: Froggified
My human friend got turned into a frog and he's been trying to base his communication with me through a computer, but he couldn't really work his way with Linux and lost the message in all those 0s and 1s.  
He jumps around angry on my desk, can you help me find his message?

### Challenge: ASCII Art
My friend Tommy is really passionate about art. Lately, he got into something called ASCII art and e-mailed me the following attachment.  
I am too afraid to tell him that I don't know how to open it. Can you help?

### Challenge: Encoding Train
I wanted to learn encodings, so I changed my e-mail password then I encoded it 20 times with base16, base32, base64 and base85, every time using a random one.  
Now I don't know how to get it back and I really need access to my e-mail. Can you take a look?

### Challenge: Infinity Hashes
Thanos had 6 Infinity Stones, but I have something better: 6 Infinity Hashes, that store the truth of the whole universe.  
Wrap it with `SSS{}` and `_` instead of space, and spread it with everyone!

### Data Manipulation
We can manually change the way data is represented, so that it will be easier to read or structure.

For large chunks of data, this could take a long time, so, in order for us to be efficient, we will have to use certain automated ways of manipulating the information.

Tools that can help us achieve this goal are ranging from programming and scripting languages, to programs like MS Excel.  
A useful Python tool for this purpose is `pandas`:
